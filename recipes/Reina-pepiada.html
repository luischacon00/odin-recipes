    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>the Reina pepiada arepa , basically the filling consists of a mixture of cooked chicken, avocado and mayonnaise, believe me (for those who have not tried them) that this filling is irresistible! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken breast, cooked and shredded</li>
        <li>1 small onion (for cooking the chicken)</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic (for cooking the chicken)</li>
        <li>2 avocados</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>precooked corn flour</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li> Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a container, mix the water, butter and half a teaspoon of MAGGI</li>
        <li>Add the flour little by little, stirring constantly and integrating well until the dough is smooth</li>
        <li>Knead for 1 min, divide the dough into 4 equal portions and make a ball with each portion. Flatten each ball between the palms of your hands to form arepas.</li>
        <li>Cook the arepas in a budare or frying pan over medium heat. Leave for 4 minutes on each side or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Separately, place the avocado and lemon juice in a bowl. With the help of a fork, mash until you obtain a puree.</li>
        <li>Add the mayonnaise, the shredded chicken, the remaining MAGGI® Naturísimo Seasoning and the cilantro. Mix well</li>
        <li>Open the arepas in half carefully and fill with the mixture, all in equal parts.</li>
